    <div class="article">
      <p> For the fifth year in a row, suspensions across New York City public schools declined. Yet, Black and Hispanic students are still receiving suspensions at higher rates than white or Asian students across all academic levels. </p>
      <p> Since his inauguration in 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio has worked to overhaul the discipline code and reduce the number of suspensions system wide. Over the past couple of years, he’s announced a series of reforms to reduce the number of
        suspensions, like cutting back on NYPD reliance in schools and encouraging and training teachers and social workers in alternative methods like “restorative justice initiatives.” This year, suspensions citywide saw a 66% decline since the
        2013-2014 school year, according to a Department of Education spokesperson. </p>
      <p> Suspensions were used as a way to curb school violence in the 1990s. With a strict discipline code – including the zero-tolerance policy – violence declined, but the number of suspensions rose sharply, according to reports from the <a
          href="https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/publications/Suspension_Report_FINAL_noSpreads.pdf"> New York
          Civil Liberties Union </a> published in 2011.</p>
      <p> There are three types of exclusionary discipline actions that take place in New York City schools, before a student is expelled from the school system. At the lowest level, a teacher can temporarily remove a student from the classroom.
        Then
        comes the “principal suspension,” in which a principal suspends a student for up to five days. The “superintendent suspension” is imposed for more serious infractions to the discipline code, and would result in a student’s suspension for
        five
        days or up to a year. Facing pressure from activists in 2019, de Blasio proposed discipline reforms to cap the number of days a student could be suspended to 20. </p>
      <p> While the 2019-2020 numbers point to the downward trend, this year was special considering the citywide shutdown at the onset of the pandemic in March. However, the spokesman for the Department of Education pointed out that even prior to
        the transition to online learning, they were set to see a reduction in suspensions this year. He noted that overall suspensions were down 12.6% in March compared to the previous school year.</p>

      <p> Reports by the NYCLU and <a href="https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DOE-Final-Report-2019.pdf">Data Collaborative for Justice (DCJ)</a> at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reveal
        that over the past two decades, Black students were three times as likely to receive suspensions than
        white students.</p>

                  t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")

            }))
          }();
        </script>

      <p> Yet, during the 2019-2020 school year, Black and Hispanic students received 43% and 40% of suspensions respectively while making up 26% and 40% of the public school student body. White students, who comprise 15% of the student body only
        received 9% of the suspensions. </p>
      <p> These disparities have endured for many years – with the DOE making significant investments in transitioning away from “punitive discipline and towards a model that emphasizes education, empathy, and safety for all students,” a spokesman
        for the DOE said.</p>
      <p> TK quote from Lindsey Foster, from NYU about the impact of these disparities on students of color. </p>

      <p> The data for the charts above was provided by the DOE’s <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/government-reports/suspension-reports"> InfoHub database</a>, which provides redacted data about school suspensions for every year since
        the 2015-2016 academic years. By federal law, if the number of suspensions or removals is
        under five, it has to be redacted to ensure the privacy of the students, according to a DOE spokesperson. The total number of suspensions was calculated by combining the principal and superintendent suspensions. </p>
